## Evaluating the Language-Based Security for Plugin Development

This repo is for evaluating the language-Based Security for Plugin Development. The developing environment is based on Intellij and employs JAVA mainly.

## Objectives
* Developing IntelliJ plug ins that try to access files, network, other parts of the application that plugin user does not expect.
* Exploring the CVE that take advantage of similar capability- based accesses and implementing them as IntelliJ plugin exploits.
* Analysis of which of these can be addressed by languages that support capability-based module systems like Wyvern.
